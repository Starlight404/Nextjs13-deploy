To push your code to a GitHub repository using Git, follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git Repository:
If you haven't already done so, initialize a Git repository in your project directory by running the following command:

git init

2. Add and Commit Your Code:
Stage the files you want to commit using the git add command, 
and then commit them with a descriptive message using the git commit command. For example:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

3. Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and create a new repository. You can create an empty repository or initialize it with a README file, depending on your preference.

4. Add Remote Repository:
After creating the repository on GitHub, you need to add the remote URL of your GitHub repository to your local Git repository. Use the following command:

git remote add origin <GitHub_Repository_URL>

5.Push to GitHub:
Finally, push your code to the GitHub repository using the git push command:
git push -u origin master


-listen. master is the root folder name. if u want to put inside another folder then git push -u origin anotherfolder
then the folder shows like master>anotherfolder



#. go to inside the folder if frontend then go to frontend first
#. right click and open git bash on this folder location.
#. git remote -v
#. "git int"
#. "git add ."
#. "git commit -m "first commit"
